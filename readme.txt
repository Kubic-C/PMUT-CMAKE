When building!
-you need to have the glfw libraries, you can compile them your self or use the pre-compiled ones provided by https://www.glfw.org/
-you need the glew libraries, and this case is similar to the one mentioned above(http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
-make sure to change pthread(if your not on linux) to whatever your operating system's threading library is.
